# timeline theme

This is a theme for my website when generating with Hugo.

At the moment this is a fairly clean and basic theme. Eventually I hope for it to look more like a timeline.

## Development

Setting up for development is easy. First, make sure you have the dependencies installed:

- [node.js & npm](http://nodejs.org)

Then install Gulp and all of the required modules and run the Gulp task:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will generate all CSS from the SCSS files found in the source folder.
